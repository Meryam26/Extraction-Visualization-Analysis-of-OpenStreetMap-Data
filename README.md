# Extraction-Visualization-Analysis-of-OpenStreetMap-Data



   In urban planning and transport research, road networks are commonly used to calculate accessibility between origins and destinations or to calculate urban shape indicators such as block size, intersection density and connectivity. The mathematical model of road networks, called graphs, has become omnipresent in the literature of urban studies in recent years. Thus, the topology and geometric characteristics of the network can be analyzed using some graph theory algorithms.
   

  So the aim of this study would initially be to extract geospatial data and successfully convert this data from maps into a graph structure that will facilitate their use to enable us to perform our applications, such as finding the shortest path between 2 points, obtaining parallel streets, obtaining statistics about street topology and many other 
applications.


In order to run the notebook file and perform the analysis, the following python packages should be installed :
matplotlib
networkx
osmnx
requests
